# Changelog

This file records notable user-facing changes. The project remains active dogfood, so protocol and storage contracts can still change before a stable release.

## [Unreleased]

- Inbox activity reports effective metadata changes and no-ops, labels aggregate model-work time, and retains visible structured omissions for bounded retrieval, incomplete reads and skipped/failed relationship checks. Historical coverage stays explicitly unknown. PIE-328.

- Tree connection groups include Backlinks and support explicit nested disclosure on resolved block targets. Siblings retain independent state; cycles expand only by user action. PIE-324.

- A missing or closed linked reader offers Enter/click to Open here once, a destination choice, or Cancel. Tree and Inbox keep their list while Detail retains draft protections. PIE-332.

- Outlinks omit repeated titles and Work-ID prefixes while retaining custom labels, fragment names and occurrence counts. PIE-329.
- Tree and Inbox Preview follow links in place, with local Back/Forward history, keyboard link selection and explicit Open in Detail. Dragging links still copies text. The destination picker retains the browsed target. PIE-326.

- Inbox review shows Activity above independently scrollable Source/Output readers when space permits, with draggable dividers and a compact fallback. Inspect saved **Before this attempt** text without Undo; current source remains separate. Technical details collapse and errors remain visible. PIE-320.

- Inbox history can be searched across all retained attempts using original capture titles, summaries and current Source/Output text. Text matches remain usable offline; optional Jev reranks a bounded shortlist using the editable Goto prompt. Cancellation restores the browsing context. The new `inbox.search` RPC requires protocol **70** and a coordinated service/client restart; capability negotiation remains a separate architecture follow-up. PIE-319.
- Inbox now opens typed Source/Output content instead of incidental session logs, exposes reader linking, and shares Tree's rich Preview reader with separate Activity controls. PIE-317 / PIE-318.
- Tree Preview has mouse controls for visibility, right/bottom/automatic placement, size buttons and divider dragging. Prefix+Shift+U and **? → New Tree** open an independent Tree without a companion Detail. PIE-315 / PIE-316.

- Clicking Tree returns keyboard focus from local Preview in beside/below layouts. Delayed selection-publication echoes cannot replace a newer Preview.

- Creating a Detail from Link destination now links the original view to it, including sidebar placements. Ordinary split commands keep their existing links.

- Tree now keeps an interactive projection-aware breadcrumb and reclaims offscreen ancestor indentation (PIE-304).

### Capture and AI instructions

- Tree can focus an occurrence as its root or open independent rooted Tree splits. Shift+Left/Right fold/reveal one hierarchy layer. Nested query results survive collapse of their physical source folder. PIE-303 / PIE-292.
- Inbox deadlines fail only the current note and let other pending work continue. The total editing budget defaults to five minutes and can be configured with `OUTLINER_INBOX_TIMEOUT_MS`. PIE-310.
- Inbox editing and bounded note answers retain native Pi sessions per attempt. Select an activity result and press `t` to inspect its transcript through the service; early interruptions are explicitly labelled snapshots. Canceled attempts remain inspectable without suppressing retry or consuming new instructions. Protocol 65; restart service and clients together. PIE-311.
- New and meaningfully edited ordinary notes receive automatic type/tag assistance. Hashtags share the property index, semantic calendar tags follow authored dates, and human corrections survive restart. Direct supported requests can be answered in the original note; complete property inventories bypass autocomplete limits. Existing notes require explicit opt-in, and tickets/other managed records retain their contracts. PIE-302.
- The hashtag/property change requires protocol 64. Restart the service and all clients together, including remote clients; older editors use incompatible property positions.
- Inbox opens directly on outstanding questions or errors, including failures older than the recent-results page. The highlighted attention count and destination-labelled shortcut keep unresolved work easy to find; history remains available without automatic view switching.
- Quick Capture retains text and cursor across closing/reopening, inserts new captures at the top of Inbox, and supports generated titles for `/send-to-outline`. Payload-bound receipts and retained uncertain submissions prevent a retry from discarding newer text. [#84](https://github.com/float-ritual-stack/pi-herdr-outliner/pull/84), [#85](https://github.com/float-ritual-stack/pi-herdr-outliner/pull/85), [#86](https://github.com/float-ritual-stack/pi-herdr-outliner/pull/86), [#120](https://github.com/float-ritual-stack/pi-herdr-outliner/pull/120)
- A service-owned automatic Inbox editor uses the configured Pi model, with optional Jev relationship judgments. Tree `Shift+I` opens results, questions, Pause/Resume, guarded Undo, and directed reconsideration. Ordinary notes stay notes; concrete tasks enter Backlog without joining a committed batch. This is a single-user editorial experiment. [#141](https://github.com/float-ritual-stack/pi-herdr-outliner/pull/141)
- Inbox and Goto instructions are editable Markdown/JSON file Resources. Saved changes apply to the next job/search; running jobs keep their captured instructions. Workspace prompt files survive upgrades, and results retain their exact text, path, and hash. Invalid files produce visible errors instead of stale fallbacks. [#142](https://github.com/float-ritual-stack/pi-herdr-outliner/pull/142)

### Navigation and reading

- **? → Inspect received keys** in Tree/Pi Detail shows raw bytes, Unicode and decoded modifiers inside the existing pane. It distinguishes Option-produced characters from actual Alt shortcuts without executing them. Ctrl+Q closes only the inspector; no keystroke log is persisted.

- Standalone Tree keeps rich Preview beside its own rows regardless of detached Details. Tree and Detail expose persistent **Opens in / Change**, with Shift+L as an Alt+L fallback. Link settings remain available in Properties; active edits/filters receive an explanation without losing their text. New readers can be placed beside another Detail, or as left/right sidebars around the Outliner area or whole Herdr tab. Existing terminal sessions and saved links survive placement. Protocol **69** requires a coordinated service/client restart. PIE-305 / PIE-306.

- Tree/Detail destination pickers show document titles, Herdr workspace/tab locations and a rich selected-document preview; unlocated/other-host readers are opt-in. Preview uses available beside/below space, supports `Alt+P` and contextual Escape, and Tree-local Preview wraps Markdown and bounds pointer selection/copy. Each Tree can compare viewport versus selection indentation with `Alt+I` or its Indent badge. PIE-304 / PIE-305 / PIE-306.

- `Alt+L` in Tree or Detail chooses its linked destination. Explicit Open follows that source-to-Detail link or a one-off destination. Pane movement does not change links; missing destinations report recovery choices without automatic splits. Current stays in place while passive selection updates a separate local Preview (`F7` switches, `Shift+F7` closes, `Alt+Enter` keeps). Drafts and active source selections protect replacement. Runtime reader locks and spatial reader pools are removed; transient watchers register as observers. Herdr reader reuse follows the Tree’s link. PIE-223 / PIE-305 / PIE-306.
- Protocol **68** removes reader-lock wire fields and adds the observer role. Restart service and all clients together. Workspace ownership locks and retained Resource revision protection remain independent. PIE-306.

- Tree `g` opens searchable results with location context and a document preview, in a Herdr popup or inside Outliner. Optional Jev ranking scores up to 80 text-selected candidates; 30 results are shown with limits disclosed. Exact identities and ordinary search work without Jev. [#139](https://github.com/float-ritual-stack/pi-herdr-outliner/pull/139)
- The opt-in `open-composed` action places Tree and Detail in one pane, with local navigation, independent view state, `F6` region switching, and explicitly detached readers. The separate-pane layout remains the default. [#133](https://github.com/float-ritual-stack/pi-herdr-outliner/pull/133)
- Reorder appears in the action menu and keybinding registry. Defaults are now Option/Alt+Up/Down for Tree reorder and Option/Alt+Shift+Right/Down for independent Details. At that release, locked Detail used `🔐` and unlocked used `🔓`; PIE-306 removes both indicators. [#138](https://github.com/float-ritual-stack/pi-herdr-outliner/pull/138), [#136](https://github.com/float-ritual-stack/pi-herdr-outliner/pull/136)
- Nested Tree inline previews stay occurrence-local. Bookmark mouse reports no longer trigger the keyboard removal shortcut. [#134](https://github.com/float-ritual-stack/pi-herdr-outliner/pull/134), [#135](https://github.com/float-ritual-stack/pi-herdr-outliner/pull/135)
- Canonical bookmarks, virtual-branch navigation, explicit Detail destinations, attention marks, typed walkthroughs, and external editor handoff support longer reading sessions. Editor recovery preserves drafts and discovers the interactive-shell editor configuration. [#78](https://github.com/float-ritual-stack/pi-herdr-outliner/pull/78), [#79](https://github.com/float-ritual-stack/pi-herdr-outliner/pull/79), [#103](https://github.com/float-ritual-stack/pi-herdr-outliner/pull/103), [#105](https://github.com/float-ritual-stack/pi-herdr-outliner/pull/105)

### Resources and comments

- Durable Resource UUIDs and provider-qualified Sources cover filesystem, web, PDF, Jira, Linear, application, and computed providers. Immutable snapshots and representations retain provenance and provider revisions; host negotiation and dependency-aware retention preserve the same identity across presentations. [#90](https://github.com/float-ritual-stack/pi-herdr-outliner/pull/90), [#97](https://github.com/float-ritual-stack/pi-herdr-outliner/pull/97), [#98](https://github.com/float-ritual-stack/pi-herdr-outliner/pull/98), [#99](https://github.com/float-ritual-stack/pi-herdr-outliner/pull/99), [#100](https://github.com/float-ritual-stack/pi-herdr-outliner/pull/100), [#101](https://github.com/float-ritual-stack/pi-herdr-outliner/pull/101)
- Tree **Show authored links** projects Outlinks and Resources without creating targets. Detail activates authored `[file::…]`, `[web::…]`, `[jira::…]`, and `[app::…]` occurrences by exact block revision and source span; repeated references stay distinct in Properties while sharing one Resource. [#111](https://github.com/float-ritual-stack/pi-herdr-outliner/pull/111), [#130](https://github.com/float-ritual-stack/pi-herdr-outliner/pull/130)
- Durable block and Resource annotations retain original evidence and append-only reconciliation history. Direct selections support filesystem text, cached web Markdown, and extracted PDF text; unresolved changes can receive bounded agent-assisted proposals. [#94](https://github.com/float-ritual-stack/pi-herdr-outliner/pull/94), [#95](https://github.com/float-ritual-stack/pi-herdr-outliner/pull/95), [#96](https://github.com/float-ritual-stack/pi-herdr-outliner/pull/96), [#108](https://github.com/float-ritual-stack/pi-herdr-outliner/pull/108), [#110](https://github.com/float-ritual-stack/pi-herdr-outliner/pull/110)
- Comments distinguish a Resource-wide thread from a particular authored reference and its passage. `[`/`]`, `Shift+C`, and `Shift+D` navigate, reply, and resolve/reopen in place. Stale or ambiguous anchors remain reachable under **Unpositioned comments** instead of marking unrelated text. [#129](https://github.com/float-ritual-stack/pi-herdr-outliner/pull/129), [#131](https://github.com/float-ritual-stack/pi-herdr-outliner/pull/131), [#132](https://github.com/float-ritual-stack/pi-herdr-outliner/pull/132)
- Multiline comment composition uses the actual body geometry to keep the cursor visible. [#112](https://github.com/float-ritual-stack/pi-herdr-outliner/pull/112)

### Persistence and recovery

- A service acquires exclusive workspace ownership before writable startup, migrations, or recovery, so a competing launch cannot interrupt the active owner's work. [#119](https://github.com/float-ritual-stack/pi-herdr-outliner/pull/119)
- Normal text writes require the integer `Block.revision` from the original read. Stale writes fail atomically; sibling moves no longer invalidate unchanged text drafts. Filesystem revisions also include a hash of the original bytes. [#121](https://github.com/float-ritual-stack/pi-herdr-outliner/pull/121), [#122](https://github.com/float-ritual-stack/pi-herdr-outliner/pull/122)
- Filesystem saves retain the submitted draft and displaced original, preserve competing replacements, and recover interrupted saves. Recovery directories remain available for manual inspection and cleanup. This is recoverable replacement with a brief absent-path interval, not atomic compare-and-swap. [#128](https://github.com/float-ritual-stack/pi-herdr-outliner/pull/128)

### Remote work and performance

- Tree, Detail, popups, CLI, and Pi clients connect through an SSH-forwarded Unix socket. Endpoint configuration is project-scoped, pane identities are host-scoped, and remote Tree/Detail startup opens both panes before awaiting registration. [#115](https://github.com/float-ritual-stack/pi-herdr-outliner/pull/115), [#116](https://github.com/float-ritual-stack/pi-herdr-outliner/pull/116), [#117](https://github.com/float-ritual-stack/pi-herdr-outliner/pull/117)
- File previews and completion read from the canonical service host, including remote clients; passive reads create no Source or Resource. [#123](https://github.com/float-ritual-stack/pi-herdr-outliner/pull/123)
- Tree loads a complete compact structural index and fetches exact bodies on demand. Detail paints primary content before optional enrichment, while its 32-target revisit cache revalidates revisions and passive preview scheduling keeps the newest target. Reused virtual projections and indexed ranked queries remove repeated work without adding a persistent search index or cursor system. [#124](https://github.com/float-ritual-stack/pi-herdr-outliner/pull/124), [#125](https://github.com/float-ritual-stack/pi-herdr-outliner/pull/125), [#127](https://github.com/float-ritual-stack/pi-herdr-outliner/pull/127)

### Workflow and onboarding

- Roadmap items use `work-stage` alone, with Queued replacing Next and Superseded separate from accepted Done. Item-side `work-batch` references preserve committed scope through progress, pause, and completion. Resume and unchanged PR synchronization preserve explicit review/rework state. [#137](https://github.com/float-ritual-stack/pi-herdr-outliner/pull/137)
- Fresh databases use workspace seed version 5. **Explore the Outliner** adds addressable feature guides and working reading/projection examples beside the existing agent documentation guide and authored-links example. Existing databases retain their customized content; package upgrades do not reinstall the seed.
- The guided installer and portable runtime discovery support source-checkout installation. Actual Herdr keyboard journeys use isolated workspaces and retain failure evidence. [#82](https://github.com/float-ritual-stack/pi-herdr-outliner/pull/82), [#83](https://github.com/float-ritual-stack/pi-herdr-outliner/pull/83), [#114](https://github.com/float-ritual-stack/pi-herdr-outliner/pull/114)
- The current JSON-lines RPC protocol is **68**. Restart the service and all clients together when upgrading across incompatible versions; [`src/types.ts`](src/types.ts) owns the current version.

### Known limits

- Tree-generated Resource opens require a valid linked Detail; missing or protected destinations fail before registration. Resource references inside Detail use its shared chooser.
- SSH authored references are application deep links, not source-backed remote files. Tracked as PIE-261.
- Metadata-only Resource fields cannot yet receive direct Detail comments. Tracked as PIE-262.
- Computed and remote-entity cached Markdown cannot yet create direct Detail text annotations. Tracked as PIE-264.
